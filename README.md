# graphic-design-portfolio
### This is a graphic design portfolio. Its a task from wejapa internship.
## No dependency is used.

### I tried building the layout with GRID positioning, it ended up wasting my time cause I wasn't able to control the height of each images to a fixed size. I gave up on GRID and later used FLEX positioning, which was way easier with Bootstrap. I'm using the rest of my week to continue learning GRID.
